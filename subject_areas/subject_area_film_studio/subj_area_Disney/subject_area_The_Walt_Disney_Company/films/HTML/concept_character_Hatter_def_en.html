    <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Hatter"> The Hatter </ sc_element> </ b> is a hat-maker, one of the participants of the Mad Tea Party.

The character did not figure in the original version of the tale.
His name and character presumably originated from the saying "Madness as a Hatter".
That, in turn, was based on the fact that hats could really go crazy with the mercury vapor used to process the felt.
However, Dr. med. H. Waldron refutes this theory, stating that mercury poisoning can cause mental disorder,
associated with excessive timidity, anxiety and unobtrusiveness, which does not correspond to the image of an eccentric and extravagant <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Hatter"> Mad Hatter </ sc_element> </ b>
