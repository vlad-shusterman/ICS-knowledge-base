    <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Alice"> Alice </ sc_element> </ b> - the main character of the cartoon <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_Alice_in_Wonderland"> "Alice in Wonderland" </ sc_element> </ b>
which is about seven years old. In the cartoon <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Alice"> Alice </ sc_element> </ b> appears as a schoolgirl
with a bizarre-logical mindset, whose straight hair "forever climb into the eyes." <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Alice"> Alice </ sc_element> </ b> was described as
tender, like a fallow deer, courteous to everyone, trusting and “inquisitive to the extreme, with that taste for life, which is available only to a happy childhood, when everything is new and good,
and Sin and Sadness are just words - empty words that mean nothing! ”
