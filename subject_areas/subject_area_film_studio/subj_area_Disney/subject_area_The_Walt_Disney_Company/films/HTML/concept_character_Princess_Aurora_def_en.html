<b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Princess_Aurora"> Princess Aurora </ sc_element> </ b> is the only daughter of King Stephen and Queen Leah,
as a child, a victim of witchcraft by a powerful evil fairy <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Maleficent"> Maleficents </ sc_element> </ b>.
Pissed off at her parents, <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Maleficent"> Maleficent </ sc_element> </ b>
sends a spell on the princess, according to which <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Princess_Aurora"> Princess Aurora </ sc_element> </ b> should
die on the day of his sixteenth birthday, pricking a finger against the spindle spinning wheel.
However, the efforts of the three good fairies <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Flora"> Flora </ sc_element> </ b>,
<b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Fauna"> Fauna </ sc_element> </ b> and
<b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Marieveza"> Marywezes </ sc_element> </ b> can soften the curse by replacing death with a deep magic dream, from which the “sleeping beauty” can be awakened only with the help of a true love kiss.
