 Light, witty and unusual children's cartoon company "Pixar". The film was directed by Oscar winner, creator of Toy Story, Monster Corporations and Up - Pete Docter, and the plot tells how five ever-conflicting emotions live in the head of a little girl who will soon have to learn how to work together . The main character is a cheerful, inquisitive girl Riley. She is eleven years old, and she lives with her parents in a small provincial town where everyone knows each other. For several years now, Riley has been friends with the same guys, goes to the same school and is secretly in love with the same boy. But she does not suspect that all her affairs, thoughts and feelings are controlled by the five basic emotions that are in her head: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust. They constantly quarrel and can not agree among themselves, but at some point they will have to do it. Riley and her parents move to the megalopolis, and if her emotions do not return to normal, a sharp change in the situation will hit the girl as much as she does.
