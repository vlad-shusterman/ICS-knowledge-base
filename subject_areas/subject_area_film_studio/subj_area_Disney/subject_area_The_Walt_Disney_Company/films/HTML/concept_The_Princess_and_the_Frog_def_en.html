<h1>  The Princess and the Frog  </h1>
The wonderful full-length cartoon “The Princess and the Frog,” which we recommend watching online with the whole family, was made by the legendary Disney studio based on the fairy tale of the same name by Elizabeth Baker. It is noteworthy that the cartoon was created according to the classical canons of hand-drawn, not computer animation. This beautiful musical story continues the tradition of famous Disney musical films, such as The Little Mermaid and Snow White. The Princess and the Frog was nominated for an Oscar and Golden Globe. Surely you have heard more than once about beautiful girls who were turned into frogs. As is well known, in such a case only the kiss of a prince can help. But what if the prince himself became a frog by the will of an evil sorcerer? Tiana is a simple waitress, but once she tries on a fancy dress princess and immediately meets Prince Nun. True, in the guise of a frog (not carnival) - he was bewitched by a voodoo sorcerer. Tiana kisses Nun, but since she is not a princess, the spell does not work. More precisely, it works the other way around, and she herself becomes a frog.
