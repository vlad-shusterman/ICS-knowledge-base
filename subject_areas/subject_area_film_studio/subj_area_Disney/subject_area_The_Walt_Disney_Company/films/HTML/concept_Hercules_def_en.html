But it seemed to Aida that was not enough, and he decided to capture Olympus as well. There were no special obstacles on his way, except, perhaps, the son of Zeus - Hercules, endowed with special power. To clear his way to Olympus, Hades kidnapped Hercules, when he was still a baby, and deprived him of all abilities, turning him into an ordinary person.
