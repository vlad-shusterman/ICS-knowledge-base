<h1>Dog's life</h1>

Dogs come in different breeds, colors and sizes. They are our most loyal and loyal friends, and we teach them good manners. Dogs are always
thinking about us, the truth, and sometimes about bacon. All of them see off every day and meet us at the threshold in the confidence
that as long as they have someone to lick and love, their life has meaning.
