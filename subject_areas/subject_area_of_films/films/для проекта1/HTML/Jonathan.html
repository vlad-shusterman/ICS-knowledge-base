<h1>Jonathan</h1>
Jonathan and John are completely different people in their worldview and psychotype. But they both have to get along ... in the same body! Jonathan is a well-mannered, manly guy. He is accustomed to remain calm and not lose self-control in difficult situations. The hero works in an architectural company as a designer and is a successful employee. Despite the obvious achievements in the work, he has no luck in his personal life because of indecision. When Jonathan after work comes home to rest, the baton goes to restless John. While Jonathan is sure that he is seeing the “seventh” dream, his alter ego Joe is whipping to the fullest. Uninhibited, energetic choleric is not averse to violate the law and spin a fleeting affair with a beauty. According to the psychiatrist of the hero Dr. Mina Nariman - the guys get along with each other, regardless of the polarity of views and beliefs. But everything changes drastically when one of them falls in love with the stunning beauty Elena.
