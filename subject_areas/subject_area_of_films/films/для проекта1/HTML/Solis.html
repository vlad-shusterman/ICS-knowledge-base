Endless expanses of space are the site of the development of dramatic events. One-on-one with his demons and the realization of imminent death turned out to be an experienced astronaut Troy Holloway. He recently lost his son, and at the same time, the desire to live. It is not surprising that, once in a situation where the line between life and death is obliterated by the minute, he does not particularly want to seek salvation. The rescue shuttle, in which the hero is located, moves towards the sun. Death is about to overtake Holloway. There is no one who could help Troy. However, he is not looking for her. But there is a weak radio signal. The command does not want to lose courageous sensible officer Through the use of intermittent extremely weak communications, the commander Roberts gives instructions to the hero sharpened in the shuttle. Troy is still not aware that the road to hell changes course towards survival. Is he ready to fight for his life in the name of the memory of his late son, in the name of himself? Can the commander find the right words to reach out to Troy's mind?
