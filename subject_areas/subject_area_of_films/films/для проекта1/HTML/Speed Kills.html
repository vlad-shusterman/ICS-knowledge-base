<h1>Speed Kills</h1>
The businessman Ben Arnoff, who did not discredit the name and reputation, always wanted to achieve great success in life. He is a professional in his field and a wonderful family man. However, Ben's soul demanded ubiquitous glory and millions. So he leaves a fairly profitable business in New Jersey and moves with his family to the coast of Miami Beach. Risking his fortune, Ben invests all the money he has accumulated in motorboat production. Along the way, the hero organizes races in which he himself willingly takes part. Contrary to fears and doubts, the motor-boat business goes uphill and brings the first dividends to the owner. Ben gets a major customer in the face of US Coast Guard officials. And then the clientele becomes more dangerous - drug barons and other thugs. But Ben does not attach importance to the person with whom he makes deals ... which is why he soon has big problems with the law and the notorious mafia scum. Will the hero cope with the troubles that have taken by surprise?
