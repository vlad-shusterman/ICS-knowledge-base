<h1> Tangled </h1>

Charming robber Flynn travels through life with ease, just because he is handsome, talkative and lucky. And it seemed that fortune was always on his side, until one day he chose a tall tower in a thicker forest than a “calm” refuge. Flynn is bound hand and foot by a young beauty named Rapunzel.
If you think that the most interesting thing in it is 21 meters of magical golden hair, then you are mistaken! Locked in a tower and desperately seeking adventure, Rapunzel decides to use Flynn as a ticket to the big world. First, a comical kidnapping, then innocent blackmail — and here our heroes are free.
