Welcome to Zveropolis - a modern city inhabited by a variety of animals, from huge elephants to tiny mice. Zveropolis is divided into areas completely repeating the natural habitat of different inhabitants - there is both an elite area of ​​the Sahara Square and an inhospitable Tundraun. In this city, there is a new police officer, a cheerful hare Judy Hopps, who from the first days of work understands how difficult it is to be small and fluffy among big and strong policemen. Judy grabs the first opportunity to prove herself, despite the fact that her partner will be a talkative sly fox Nick Wilde. Together they will have to solve a complicated matter.
